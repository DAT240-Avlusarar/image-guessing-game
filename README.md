# image-guessing-game
Our team will use the mindset of agile software developement to create an image guessing game. The game is created with a domain-driven-design approach and object oriented principles. Automatic continuous integrated tests are done through github Actions. Docker is used to improve portability of the software program. The game is written in the programming language c#.
